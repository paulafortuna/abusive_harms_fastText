# abusive_harms_fastText

In this repository we have the scripts that support the fastText experiment of our paper:


The complete experiment pipeline can be found here.

We ran the model in its version 0.9.2 with 300 dimension-FastText pretrained vectors, Skipgram Hierarchical softmax loss function, learning rate of 1.0, considering 1 as minimal number of word occurrences, bi-grams, and 25 epochs.

FastText models require data to be in a specific shape.
